# Everything About the nRF52840 USB Dongles
Anything I can find about the various nrf52840 usb dongles by Nordic, Arduino, Adafruit, Sparkfun, MakerDiary and others


Created Dec 7th, 2019

# Basic concept

The Nordic nRF52840 SOC is getting a lot of publicity for it's great BLE abilities and has been embedded in many boards from Nordic, Particle, Adafruit, Sparkfun, MakerDiary and Arduino. Unfortunately each company has their own way to program these boards with varying exposure to the SOC's abilities.

My Openthread and Nordic SDK Online Browser compatible Docker. (Yes it is amazing).  [My Gitpod Github Openthread](https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-gitpod-of-openthread) This takes a very long time to build from scratch. First try the snapshot, takes a while to load, but worth it, Generated Dec 4th, 2019 updated with the Nordic sdk.
