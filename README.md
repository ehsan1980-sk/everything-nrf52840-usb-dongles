Anything I can find about the various nrf52840 usb dongles by Nordic, Arduino, Adafruit, Sparkfun, MakerDiary and others

# Basic concept

The Nordic nRF52840 SOC is getting a lot of publicity for it's great BLE abilities and has been embedded in many boards from Nordic, Particle, Adafruit, Sparkfun, MakerDiary and Arduino. Unfortunately each company has their own way to program these boards with varying exposure to the SOC's abilities.
